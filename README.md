# CSS385 Game

This is a game created in several parts for my CSS385 class.

It can be played [here](https://loukylor.github.io/CSS385-Game/).

## Controls

The controls are simple:
 - **WASD** to move around
 - **Mouse** to look around
 - **Space** to jump
 - **Shift** to sprint

If the controls aren't working, make sure to click inside the player window
(not the tab itself, but the 3d environment) so that your mouse dissapears.

## Mechanics

The game is a simple 3d platformer, where the main character simply moves around
platform to platform towards an end goal.

Currently, there is only one level and no proper end/win screen. This level is a
few simple platforms with a red obelisk at the last one. Upon reaching this 
obelisk, the text "WIN!" appears on the screen. That is all there is to the 
project right now, as it is a simple tech demo more than anything.

## Challenges

As usual, platformers are deceptively simple, and some of the logic behind the
different states the player can be in, and the respective characteristics of
each state, can become complicated. Luckily, I have written a platformer in the
past and was able to utilize some of the same code in this project, saving time.

Other than that, this project was relatively simple to set up and create
everything for. If I had to estimate the time it took, I would say around 6-7
hours. About 3 hours on Monday (3/25/24), and 4 on Wednesday (3/27/24).
