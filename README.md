# CSS385 Game

This is a game created in several parts for my CSS385 class.

It can be played [here](https://loukylor.github.io/CSS385-Game/).

## Controls

The controls are simple:
 - **WASD** to move around
 - **Mouse** to look around
 - **Space** to jump
 - **Shift** to sprint

If the controls aren't working, make sure to click inside the player window
(not the tab itself, but the 3d environment) so that your mouse dissapears.

## Mechanics

The game is a simple 3d platformer, where the main character simply moves around
platform to platform towards an end goal.

Currently, there is only one level and no proper end/win screen. This level is a
few simple platforms with a red obelisk at the last one. Upon reaching this 
obelisk, the text "WIN!" appears on the screen. That is all there is to the 
project right now, as it is a simple tech demo more than anything.
